## About
This is an enthusiastic learning project by karthikeya (yeah me), a basic blog with minimal features. Goal was to keep things minimal. What you can do here? well its just upto basic blogging. Technically it is a micro blogging kinda shit cause you can't do articles and stuff (like with images, styling etc.., you get it right.). Just write whatever you can want cause none of this shit is going to saved or stored some where (no database bro). Thats right, every thing is only saved until you are using it. You might be thinking this is weird but yeah this a enthusiastic learning project for me as I said earlier (reminding you respectfully). The whole holy cause is to practically apply whatever I learned so far as much as effectively I can.
